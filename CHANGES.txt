Next release
============

Fixes
--------

- replace serialize_experiment_setup with Experiment.to_yaml, leftover from the old experiment dictionary setup (#25)
- catch cases in the ConvergenceChecker where the difference between iterations is numerically zero, but the reference is also numerically zero (happened for ice albedo in case of no sea ice...)


AOSCMcoupling 0.4.1
===================

Fixes
-----

- expose `get_ifs_forcing_info` (can now be imported as `from AOSCMcoupling import get_ifs_forcing_info`)

===================

Features
--------
- provide helper function for computing information about the forcing file (#23) 
- support setting ice time step differently from ocean time step (#21)

Fixes

AOSCMcoupling 0.3.0
===================

Features
--------
- support restarting SWR run from an iteration > 1 (#18)
- allow to redo iterations even if output already exists (#18)
- expose SI3 tuning parameters for EC-Earth 4 AOSCM (#15)
- new SWR convergence criteria (#17)
